# Cylon.js For i2c

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics, physical computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

This module provides drivers for i2c devices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C). You would not normally use this module directly, instead it is used by Cylon.js adaptors that have i2c support.

NOTE: This LCD driver only supports PCF8574 based displays at the moment, we are working on adding support for other LCDs.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c)

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install cylon cylon-i2c`

## Example

```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

// Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot({
  connections: {
    arduino: { adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' }
  },

  devices: {
    blinkm: { driver: 'blinkm'}
  },

  work: function(my) {
    var lit = false;
    my.blinkm.off()
    every((1).seconds(), function() {
      if (lit === true) {
        lit = false;
        my.blinkm.rgb(0xaa, 0, 0);
      } else {
        lit = true;
        my.blinkm.rgb(0, 0, 0);
      }
    });
  }
}).start();
```

## Hardware Support

  - BlinkM RGB LED
  - BMP180 Barometric Pressure + Temperature sensor
  - HMC6352 Digital Compass
  - LCD
  - LIDAR-Lite
  - LSM9DS0G 9 Degrees of Freedom IMU 
  - LSM9DS0XM 9 Degrees of Freedom IMU
  - MPL115A2 Digital Barometer & Thermometer
  - MPU6050 Triple Axis Accelerometer and Gyro
  - PCA9685 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver

More drivers are coming soon...
